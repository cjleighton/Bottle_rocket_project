# Bottle_rocket_project
This was a project I completed at CU Boulder for ASEN 2012: Experimental and Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering Sciences.  It's built around numerically solving differential equations that describe the rocket's flight, and accounts for things like the rocket's mass changing, the thrust changing, and drag.
