# Bottle_rocket_project
This was a project I completed at CU Boulder for ASEN 2012: Experimental and Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering Sciences.  It's based on using MATLAB's built-in functions to numerically solve differential equations that describe the rocket's flight, and it accounts for things like the rocket's mass changing, the thrust changing, and drag.
